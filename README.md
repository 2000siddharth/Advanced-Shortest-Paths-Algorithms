# Advanced-Shortest-Paths-Algorithms
Java Code for Contraction Hierarchies Algorithm, A-Star Algorithm and Bidirectional Dijkstra Algorithm. Tested and Verified Code.

Bidirectional Dijkstra is tested on Verices=1,000,000 and Edges=60,00,000.
A-Star is tested on Vertices=110,000 and Edges=250,000.
Contraction Hierarchies is tested on Vertices=110,000 and Edges=250,000.
